How to approach monitoring spikes in **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL / Aurora PostgreSQL**.

When CloudWatch or Performance Insights shows a graph trending high (CPU, memory, connections, I/O, etc.), the right action depends on **what metric is spiking**.

---

# 🔎 Step 1: Identify the Metric That’s High

In AWS RDS PostgreSQL monitoring, the most common metrics to watch are:

* **CPUUtilization** → High CPU usage
* **FreeableMemory** → Memory pressure
* **DatabaseConnections** → Too many active connections
* **Disk I/O / WriteIOPS / ReadIOPS** → Storage bottlenecks
* **Commit Latency / Read Latency** → Slow queries or bad indexes
* **ReplicationLag** → Replicas not keeping up with primary
* **Deadlocks** → Lock contention in queries

---

# 🛠 Step 2: Troubleshooting Actions

### 1. **High CPU Usage**

**Causes:** Expensive queries, missing indexes, high parallelism, or too many active sessions.
**Actions:**

* Use **Performance Insights** → Check “Top SQL” queries consuming CPU.
* Run `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` on slow queries to see if indexes are missing.
* Add missing indexes, or rewrite queries to avoid sequential scans.
* Tune `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, and `effective_cache_size`.
* If workloads are expected:

  * Scale up instance (bigger vCPU).
  * Add **read replicas** for offloading SELECT queries.

---

### 2. **High Memory Usage / Low FreeableMemory**

**Causes:** Poor configuration (too high `work_mem`), large joins, long-running transactions.
**Actions:**

* Check active queries:

  ```sql
  SELECT pid, age(clock_timestamp(), query_start), usename, query
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  WHERE state = 'active';
  ```
* Terminate long-running queries if they are stuck (`pg_terminate_backend(pid)`).
* Tune memory parameters (`work_mem`, `maintenance_work_mem`, `shared_buffers`).
* Ensure **connection pooling** (PgBouncer, RDS Proxy) to avoid many idle backends hogging memory.

---

### 3. **High Connections**

**Causes:** Applications opening too many connections without pooling.
**Actions:**

* Enable **Amazon RDS Proxy** (recommended).
* Implement PgBouncer/pgpool for connection pooling.
* Increase `max_connections` only if necessary, but note: each connection consumes memory.
* Fix application logic to reuse connections instead of opening new ones frequently.

---

### 4. **Disk I/O Spikes (High Read/Write IOPS)**

**Causes:** Large table scans, missing indexes, checkpoints, VACUUM activity.
**Actions:**

* Check slow queries (`pg_stat_statements` extension).
* Add proper indexes to reduce full table scans.
* Monitor autovacuum → If autovacuum is not aggressive enough, tune `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_limit`, `autovacuum_work_mem`.
* Consider moving to **Aurora PostgreSQL** if workload exceeds IOPS capacity.
* Use **Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2)** storage if consistent IOPS is required.

---

### 5. **High Replication Lag**

**Causes:** Long transactions, heavy writes, insufficient replica instance size.
**Actions:**

* Check lag with:

  ```sql
  SELECT client_addr, state, sent_lsn, replay_lsn, 
         pg_wal_lsn_diff(sent_lsn, replay_lsn) AS replication_lag_bytes
  FROM pg_stat_replication;
  ```
* Tune `max_wal_size`, `wal_compression`, `checkpoint_timeout`.
* Ensure replicas are powerful enough to handle replay.
* Split heavy writes to different tables or partitions.

---

### 6. **Deadlocks / Lock Contention**

**Causes:** Conflicting queries updating the same rows/tables.
**Actions:**

* Identify blocking queries:

  ```sql
  SELECT blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
         blocked_activity.query AS blocked_query,
         blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
         blocking_activity.query AS blocking_query
  FROM pg_locks blocked_locks
  JOIN pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
  JOIN pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype 
                                AND blocking_locks.DATABASE IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.DATABASE
                                AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
                                AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
                                AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
                                AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
  JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid;
  ```
* Kill blocking queries (`pg_terminate_backend(pid)`).
* Redesign application logic to reduce lock contention (shorter transactions, row-level locking).

---

# 🚀 Step 3: Preventive Measures

* Enable **Performance Insights** and use it daily.
* Set up **CloudWatch alarms** for CPU > 80%, FreeableMemory < 20%, ReplicationLag > 30s.
* Use **Auto-scaling** with Aurora PostgreSQL for read replicas.
* Regularly **VACUUM & ANALYZE** tables (or let autovacuum do its job).
* Use **partitioning** and **indexing** for large datasets.
* Upgrade PostgreSQL version to get latest performance improvements.

# ✅ Summary

When a graph shows PostgreSQL metrics spiking in AWS RDS:

1. **Identify the bottleneck (CPU, Memory, I/O, Connections, Replication, Locks).**
2. **Investigate with pg\_stat\_activity, pg\_stat\_statements, Performance Insights.**
3. **Take targeted actions**: add indexes, tune queries, enable pooling, scale instance, or optimize parameters.
4. **Set up preventive monitoring** with alarms and best practices.
