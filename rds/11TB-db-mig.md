migrating an **11 TB PostgreSQL database** from on-premises to AWS requires carefully weighing **Aurora, RDS for PostgreSQL, and self-managed PostgreSQL on EC2**. Each option has strengths and limitations depending on **storage limits, migration methods, HA/DR requirements, and workload patterns**.

Let’s break this down step by step.

# 🔑 Step 1: Storage Limits & Architecture Comparison

| Feature              | **Aurora PostgreSQL**                                         | **Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL**                    | **PostgreSQL on EC2**                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Max Storage**      | Up to **128 TB** (auto-scaling)                               | Up to **64 TB** (General Purpose SSD & io1/io2)  | Depends on EC2 + EBS → up to **64 TB per EBS volume** (can stripe for 100s of TB) |
| **Storage Growth**   | Auto-expands in 10 GB increments                              | Manual allocation (pre-set at instance creation) | Fully manual (resize EBS, LVM striping, etc.)                                     |
| **Replication**      | 6 copies across 3 AZs, <10 ms replica lag                     | Asynchronous read replicas (max 5)               | Manual replication (Streaming Replication, Bucardo, etc.)                         |
| **Read Scaling**     | Up to 15 read replicas                                        | Up to 5 read replicas                            | Unlimited replicas (but self-managed)                                             |
| **HA & Failover**    | Built-in Multi-AZ, \~30s failover                             | Multi-AZ standby, \~60–120s failover             | Manual HA setup (Patroni, pgpool, etc.)                                           |
| **Backup & Restore** | Continuous backups to S3, point-in-time restore               | Continuous backups to S3, PITR                   | Manual backup (pg\_dump, pgBackRest, WAL shipping to S3)                          |
| **Version Support**  | Aurora lags slightly behind vanilla PostgreSQL                | Close to upstream PostgreSQL                     | Full control, any version                                                         |
| **Performance**      | Optimized for cloud workloads, 3–5× faster than RDS (claimed) | Good for general OLTP/OLAP                       | Depends on instance/EBS tuning                                                    |
| **Migration Tools**  | DMS, pg\_dump/restore, logical replication                    | DMS, pg\_dump/restore, logical replication       | Any PostgreSQL-native tool                                                        |

# 🔑 Step 2: Migration Considerations for 11 TB

### ✅ Aurora PostgreSQL

**Possible when:**

* You need **auto-scaling storage** (no manual intervention up to 128 TB).
* HA, durability, and read scaling are top priorities.
* You can accept Aurora not always being 100% feature-parity with upstream PostgreSQL (e.g., some extensions missing).

**Challenges:**

* Migration of 11 TB may take long → best via **logical replication** or **AWS DMS with ongoing replication**.
* Aurora storage is *proprietary* → once in, you can’t export data files (must use logical export to move away).

---

### ✅ RDS for PostgreSQL

**Possible when:**

* Your DB is ≤ 64 TB (11 TB fits fine).
* You need near-upstream PostgreSQL compatibility.
* You want managed backups, patching, and Multi-AZ.

**Challenges:**

* Must pre-allocate storage; resizing later = downtime.
* Max read replicas = 5 (less scaling than Aurora).
* Failover slower than Aurora.

---

### ✅ PostgreSQL on EC2

**Possible when:**

* You need **full control** (custom extensions, tuning, Postgres version).
* DB > 64 TB (only way to go beyond RDS/Aurora limits using EBS striping).
* You need to keep architecture close to on-prem.

**Challenges:**

* You manage everything (backups, HA, patching, monitoring).
* Failover and replication = DIY (Patroni, pgBackRest, WAL shipping).
* Not “managed service” → more ops overhead.

# 🔑 Step 3: Migration Pathways for 11 TB

Since 11 TB is **very large**, migration method matters.

### **Option A: Logical Dump/Restore**

* `pg_dump` → S3 → Import into RDS/Aurora.
* ❌ Not practical for 11 TB (would take days/weeks + downtime).

### **Option B: Physical Backup**

* `pg_basebackup` or `pgBackRest` → ship to S3 → restore on EC2 or RDS Custom.
* ❌ Not supported for Aurora / standard RDS (you cannot just copy data files).
* ✅ Works for EC2 self-managed.

### **Option C: AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**

* Set up continuous replication from on-prem to Aurora or RDS until cutover.
* ✅ Best for minimizing downtime.
* ⚠ Slower if network bandwidth is low (need Direct Connect or Snowball Edge for initial load).

### **Option D: Logical Replication**

* Use **pglogical** or native logical replication.
* Replicate live changes until sync.
* ✅ Works for Aurora and RDS (with supported versions).

# 🔑 Step 4: Recommendation for Your Case (11 TB On-Prem → AWS)

* If you want **managed service + scaling + HA** → **Aurora PostgreSQL** is best.

  * Auto-scales to 128 TB (future growth).
  * Handles read scaling better.
  * Great if you don’t need every PostgreSQL extension.

* If you want **PostgreSQL compatibility + stability** → **RDS for PostgreSQL** is best.

  * Handles 11 TB (well under 64 TB limit).
  * Closer to upstream PostgreSQL.
  * Migration easier if you use extensions Aurora doesn’t support.

* If you need **>64 TB or full control** → **PostgreSQL on EC2**.

  * More ops overhead.
  * Best if you have specialized tuning or want beyond managed service limits.

# 📊 Updated Storage Limits (2025)

| Service                | Max Storage per DB                                     | Scaling Type                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| **Aurora PostgreSQL**  | 128 TB                                                 | Auto-scaling (10 GB increments)  |
| **RDS for PostgreSQL** | 64 TB                                                  | Fixed (set at instance creation) |
| **PostgreSQL on EC2**  | 64 TB per EBS volume (aggregate >100 TB with striping) | Manual                           |

---

✅ **Summary:**

* For your **11 TB migration**, the most balanced choice is **RDS for PostgreSQL** (if you need compatibility) or **Aurora PostgreSQL** (if you prioritize scaling + HA).
* Migration should be done via **DMS with continuous replication** + possibly **Snowball Edge** for initial bulk load.
* **EC2 PostgreSQL** only makes sense if you need >64 TB or full control.
