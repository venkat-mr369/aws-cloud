| **Your VPCs**                        | A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is your private network in AWS where you can run servers, databases, and apps securely. It is completely isolated from other AWS users. | An e-commerce site creates one VPC for production and another for testing. This separation ensures test servers don’t interfere with live customer data.    |
