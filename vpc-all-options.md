| **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)**        | A private, secure network inside AWS where you can launch and manage resources like servers and databases. You control subnets, routing, and connectivity. | Example: An e-commerce company creates a VPC with public subnets for web servers and private subnets for databases. Internet Gateways allow customers to access the site, while NAT Gateways let backend servers update software securely. |
| **Your VPCs**                          | Collections of virtual networks you create in AWS. Each VPC can be fully isolated and customized.                                                          | Example: A bank creates separate VPCs for development, testing, and production to ensure strict separation of workloads.                                                                                                                   |
| **Subnets**                            | Smaller sections of a VPC where resources like servers run. Can be public (internet-facing) or private (internal only).                                    | Example: A healthcare app stores its patient database in a private subnet while web apps run in a public subnet, ensuring sensitive data isn’t exposed.                                                                                    |
| **Route Tables**                       | Rules that decide how traffic moves inside the VPC and to outside networks.                                                                                | Example: A gaming company routes traffic from private servers through a NAT Gateway so they can download updates but remain hidden from the internet.                                                                                      |
| **Internet Gateways**                  | Gateways that let resources in your VPC talk to the internet.                                                                                              | Example: A startup hosts its website on EC2 in a VPC. The Internet Gateway connects the public-facing servers to users online.                                                                                                             |
| **Egress-only Internet Gateways**      | Special gateways that allow IPv6 traffic from private resources to go out but not allow incoming traffic.                                                  | Example: A financial firm uses this to let its IPv6-enabled servers download updates securely without exposing them to hackers.                                                                                                            |
| **DHCP Option Sets**                   | Settings that define DNS, domain name, and other networking rules for your VPC.                                                                            | Example: A company uses DHCP Option Sets to enforce all servers in the VPC to use internal DNS servers for security.                                                                                                                       |
| **Elastic IPs**                        | Fixed public IP addresses that you can assign to AWS resources.                                                                                            | Example: A SaaS company uses Elastic IPs so their app server keeps the same IP address even if restarted.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Managed Prefix Lists**               | Predefined sets of IP ranges that simplify network configuration.                                                                                          | Example: An enterprise uses AWS-managed prefix lists to easily allow access to all AWS service IPs in firewall rules.                                                                                                                      |
| **NAT Gateways**                       | Gateways that allow private subnet resources to access the internet but prevent incoming traffic.                                                          | Example: A research lab allows its private servers to fetch updates and patches while blocking inbound internet connections.                                                                                                               |
| **Peering Connections**                | Direct network links between two VPCs so they can communicate privately.                                                                                   | Example: A company with one VPC for HR systems and another for payroll connects them securely using VPC peering.                                                                                                                           |
| **Security – Network ACLs**            | Network ACLs are like security guards at the subnet level, checking and controlling all traffic in and out.                                                | Example: A bank applies strict rules in NACLs to block traffic from suspicious IP ranges at the subnet level.                                                                                                                              |
| **Security – Security Groups**         | Security groups act like firewalls for individual servers (instances). They allow or deny specific traffic.                                                | Example: A media company’s web servers only accept HTTP/HTTPS traffic, and DB servers only accept connections from the app servers.                                                                                                        |
| **PrivateLink & Lattice – Endpoints**  | PrivateLink lets you connect to AWS services or partner services privately without internet.                                                               | Example: A fintech company connects its VPC privately to AWS S3 via PrivateLink for secure data transfers.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Endpoint Services**                  | Services you create and share securely with other VPCs via PrivateLink.                                                                                    | Example: A payment gateway company provides APIs to partners through endpoint services, ensuring secure communication.                                                                                                                     |
| **Service Networks**                   | Logical grouping of services inside AWS VPC Lattice to simplify service-to-service communication.                                                          | Example: A logistics company uses service networks to organize microservices like tracking, payments, and notifications.                                                                                                                   |

Do you want me to now **put this into a Word file with two big tables (Description + Use Case)** so you can use it for **training/presentations**?
