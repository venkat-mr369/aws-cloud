### ðŸ“Œ AWS Networking

1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**
   Example â€“ An e-commerce company launches a VPC with multiple subnets (public for web servers, private for databases). Security groups allow only HTTPS to the web servers, and NAT gateways allow private instances to download updates securely.

2. **Security & Networking:**
   Example â€“ A financial services firm uses Security Groups to allow DB access only from specific app servers. DNS Firewall blocks malicious domains, ensuring employees donâ€™t accidentally connect to phishing sites.

3. **Network Firewall:**
   Example â€“ A healthcare provider sets firewall policies to inspect traffic with TLS inspection for HIPAA compliance. Rule groups block unauthorized protocols, and firewall endpoints monitor traffic across VPCs.

4. **VPN & Verified Access:**
   Example â€“ A global enterprise sets up a Site-to-Site VPN between their on-prem data center and AWS. Remote employees connect via Client VPN, and Verified Access ensures only authorized devices and users can log in.

5. **Transit Gateway & Traffic Mirroring:**
   Example â€“ A multinational corporation connects 20+ VPCs across multiple regions using a Transit Gateway, simplifying routing. Security teams use Traffic Mirroring to capture packets and analyze potential threats in real time.

| **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**         | An **e-commerce company** sets up a VPC with three tiers: public subnets for web servers, private subnets for databases, and isolated subnets for analytics workloads. The web servers connect to the internet through an Internet Gateway, while NAT Gateways let private instances download patches without being exposed. Security Groups restrict access to databases only from application servers. This ensures **scalability, isolation, and strong security** while supporting compliance requirements.                                                                  |
| **Security & Networking**               | A **financial services firm** enforces strict rules using Security Groups and NACLs. Only application servers can query databases, while all other access is denied. They deploy **AWS PrivateLink** to connect securely to partner services without exposing traffic to the internet. **DNS Firewall** prevents employees from resolving known malicious domains, reducing phishing and malware risks. Service networks organize workloads into logical groups, making it easier to enforce **micro-segmentation and zero-trust principles**.                                   |
| **Network Firewall**                    | A **healthcare provider** requires HIPAA compliance. They deploy AWS Network Firewall to filter traffic between application and database tiers. **Firewall policies** enforce protocol restrictions (e.g., blocking SMB traffic). **TLS inspection** decrypts and inspects encrypted traffic to detect threats before re-encrypting. Centralized rule groups make it easier for the security team to manage thousands of rules. Firewall endpoints are integrated with VPCs to continuously monitor **east-west (internal) and north-south (internet) traffic flows**.           |
| **VPN & Verified Access**               | A **global enterprise** connects its on-premises datacenters to AWS using **Site-to-Site VPNs** for branch offices, while remote employees use **AWS Client VPN** for secure access. Instead of relying on passwords alone, the company adopts **AWS Verified Access** for zero-trust authentication. Verified Access integrates with identity providers (Okta, Microsoft Entra ID) to ensure that only compliant devices and verified users gain entry. This provides **fine-grained control, device posture validation, and reduced reliance on traditional VPN bottlenecks**. |
| **Transit Gateway & Traffic Mirroring** | A **multinational corporation** runs 20+ VPCs across regions for dev, test, and production workloads. Instead of complex peering, they use **AWS Transit Gateway** as a central hub, reducing routing complexity and costs. Multicast support enables live video distribution across regions for their global workforce. Meanwhile, **Traffic Mirroring** is applied to production VPCs to replicate packets to IDS/IPS systems for deep inspection. Security teams analyze mirrored traffic to detect threats and meet **regulatory auditing requirements**.                    |
