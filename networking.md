### üìå Use Case Examples (Deeper Explanation)

1. **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):**
   Example ‚Äì An e-commerce company launches a VPC with multiple subnets (public for web servers, private for databases). Security groups allow only HTTPS to the web servers, and NAT gateways allow private instances to download updates securely.

2. **Security & Networking:**
   Example ‚Äì A financial services firm uses Security Groups to allow DB access only from specific app servers. DNS Firewall blocks malicious domains, ensuring employees don‚Äôt accidentally connect to phishing sites.

3. **Network Firewall:**
   Example ‚Äì A healthcare provider sets firewall policies to inspect traffic with TLS inspection for HIPAA compliance. Rule groups block unauthorized protocols, and firewall endpoints monitor traffic across VPCs.

4. **VPN & Verified Access:**
   Example ‚Äì A global enterprise sets up a Site-to-Site VPN between their on-prem data center and AWS. Remote employees connect via Client VPN, and Verified Access ensures only authorized devices and users can log in.

5. **Transit Gateway & Traffic Mirroring:**
   Example ‚Äì A multinational corporation connects 20+ VPCs across multiple regions using a Transit Gateway, simplifying routing. Security teams use Traffic Mirroring to capture packets and analyze potential threats in real time.
